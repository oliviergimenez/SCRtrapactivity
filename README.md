# Sensitivity of spatial capture-recapture models to errors in trap activity 

In France and Switzerland, we have camera trap surveys that are conducted to estimate lynx density. 
For intensive/deterministic surveys, the period of activity of traps is known. For opportunistic surveys, we most often do not know the period of activity of traps. 

Our objective is to combine data from both surveys, intensive/deterministic and opportunistic surveys. 

Before analysing real data, we will conduct a simulation study to assess the sensitivity of spatial capture-recapture models 
to errors in the determination of the duration of activity of camera traps. 

In other words, we would like to estimate the bias in density estimates when we falsely assume that all the traps we active all the time, 
while in reality some of them were inactive for some time due to malfunctions or rotations. 

As a first step, we will simulate data with 64 traps, and 10 capture occasions, and half of the traps (randomly picked) went inactive half way (from occasion 6 up to occasion 10).
